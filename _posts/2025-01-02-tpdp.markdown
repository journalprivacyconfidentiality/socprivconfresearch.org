The workshop is intended to be an occasion for researchers from different research areas, such as computer science, statistics, and data analysis, to discuss the recent developments in the theory and practice of differential privacy.
*JPC* publishes selected,  expanded, and peer-reviewed workshop papers from each workshop, under the editorial supervision of one of the TPDP organizers.
