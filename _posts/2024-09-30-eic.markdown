The Society of Privacy and Confidentiality Research (SPCR), publisher of the [Journal of Privacy and Confidentiality](https://journalprivacyconfidentiality.org/) (JPC), seeks applications and nominations for the Editor-in-Chief, for a three-year term beginning January 1, 2025, or as soon thereafter as mutually convenient.

The Editor-in-Chief is appointed by and responsible to the SPCR Board of Directors, leads the Editorial Board, oversees the Managing Editors, and sets the tone and emphases of the JPC. Those who have served previously as Editor-in-Chief are the late Stephen Fienberg, John Abowd and Cynthia Dwork. Under their leadership, JPC has matured into part of the scientific infrastructure in privacy and confidentiality research, especially by bridging the multiple contributing disciplines. JPC has been and will remain an open access journal. Currently, there are approximately 45 submissions per year, of which 12 are published.

Applicants should send a letter of interest and CV to eic_search@journalprivacyconfidentiality.org. Nominations may be sent to the same address. The deadline for both is October 31, 2024. Materials received later than that date will be considered at the sole discretion of the Search Committee.
